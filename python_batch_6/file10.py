#Prog10. title() makes all first letter of each word in the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case. Create a program that do the same functionality without using title() function.
# Iterate through characters, capitalizing the first letter of each word (after a non-alphabetic character) and lowercasing the rest, 
# using isalpha(), upper(), and lower().
